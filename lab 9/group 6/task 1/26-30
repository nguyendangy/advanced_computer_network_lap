     192.168.1.0/32 is subnetted, 1 subnets
O       192.168.1.1 [110/1001] via 172.16.0.10, 00:03:04, FastEthernet0/0

FastEthernet0/0 OSPF Cost: Prior to the change, the cost was calculated with a reference bandwidth of 100 Mbps.
 With the new setting (10000 Mbps), and given the manual bandwidth setting of 10 Mbps on FastEthernet0/0,
  the OSPF cost calculation would be 10000 / 10 = 1000. This significantly increases the cost,
   which you should see reflected in the OSPF interface and route metrics.
OSPF Route Metrics:
Routes via FastEthernet0/0 showing a metric of 1001 likely indicate the interface cost has been added to 
some additional internal OSPF costs to calculate the total route metric.
