Ping from R_Y to 10.6.7.61:
From R_Y:
R_7#ping 10.6.7.61

Check the NAT Table on R_6:
show ip nat translation

Ping from R_6 to R_Y:
ping 10.6.7.2

Check the NAT Table on R_6:
show ip nat translation

Ping and Telnet from PC1 to R_Y:
ping 10.6.7.2
telnet 10.6.7.2

Check the NAT Table on R_6:
R_6#show ip nat translation

Check if PC2 Can Connect to R_Y:
ping 10.6.7.2

section2:
Dynamic NAT Configuration
Add Route to Public Address on R_Y:
R_7 conf t
ip route 192.168.6.0 255.255.255.0 10.6.7.1
Define Public Address Pool on R_6:
R_6(config)#
ip nat pool PUBLIC_R_6 192.168.6.61 192.168.6.62 netmask 255.255.255.0

Create Access List for Local Networks:
R_6(config)#
ip access-list standard NAT_LAN_6
permit 172.16.6.0 0.0.0.255
permit 172.16.106.0 0.0.0.255
exit

Activate Dynamic NAT:R_6(config)
ip nat inside source list NAT_LAN_6 pool PUBLIC_R_6

Clear Previous NAT Translations and Statistics:
clear ip nat translation *
clear ip nat statistics

Remove Static NAT:
no ip nat inside source static 172.16.6.61 10.6.7.61

Step 2: Verify Dynamic NAT
Ping from PC1 and PC2 to R_Y:
From PC1 and PC2:
ping 10.6.7.2

Check NAT Translations and Statistics on R_6:
show ip nat translations
show ip nat statistics
debug ip nat

Check the Effect of a Third Device Trying to Connect:
Change IP on PC2 temporarily to 172.16.6.63.
Attempt to ping from PC2 to R_Y:
ping 10.6.7.2
Verify that the third device does not get a public IP address.

Clear NAT Tables and Verify Pings:
R_6#clear ip nat translation *

Verify ping from R_7:
R_7#ping 192.168.6.61 expect 0/5

Purpose of Static NAT:
Static NAT is used to map a single internal IP address to a single
 external IP address. This allows devices on an external network 
 to access a specific internal device using a fixed external IP address.
Purpose of Dynamic NAT:
Dynamic NAT maps internal IP addresses to a pool of external
 IP addresses. This is useful when you have more internal devices
  than available external IP addresses, and not all internal devices
   need simultaneous access to the external network.
