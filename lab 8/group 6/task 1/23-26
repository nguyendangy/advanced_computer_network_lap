Before Setting Passive:
show ip ospf interface FastEthernet0/0


Set the Interface to Passive Mode:
router ospf 6
passive-interface FastEthernet0/0


After Setting Passive:
show ip ospf interface FastEthernet0/0
show ip protocols

Step 24: Check Network Visibility on Neighboring Routers
Check from a Neighbor Router:
show ip ospf neighbor
show ip route

Step 25: Set All Interfaces to Passive Mode and Verify Network Impact
router ospf 6
passive-interface default
show ip ospf interface



Check Network Availability from Neighbor Router:
10.X.Y.2
10.6.7.2
show ip route
show ip ospf neighbor


26: 
router ospf 6
no passive-interface default

Check Network Availability from Neighbor Router:
10.X.Y.2
10.6.7.2
show ip route
show ip ospf neighbor
