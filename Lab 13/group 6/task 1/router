Step 16: telnet from pc 61 to R_7 and ping below:
R_7#ping 192.168.61.61 source 192.168.71.70
R_7#ping 192.168.62.62 source 192.168.72.70
R_7#ping 192.168.63.60 source 192.168.73.70
R_7#ping 192.168.64.60 source 192.168.74.70




remove int that if need:

access-list 106 deny ip 192.168.61.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.71.0 0.0.0.255

 Step 23
 Edition of an extended, numbered access list
23. Add additional rules to the created access list.
Rules to add:
Deny access from network X2 to network Y1.
Deny access from network X1 to network Y2.
Allow other traffic.

conf t 
access-list 106 remark denied access from 62 to 71
access-list 106 deny ip 192.168.62.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.71.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 106 remark denied access from 61 to 72
access-list 106 deny ip 192.168.61.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.72.0 0.0.0.255

remember that remove this line first, then its will working, or move that in the last list:
access-list 106 permit ip any any

check access list in sh run:
sh run | include access-list 106

Before:
sh run | include access-list 106
R_6#sh run | include access-list 106
access-list 106 remark denied access from 61 to 71
access-list 106 deny ip 192.168.61.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.71.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 106 permit ip any any
access-list 106 remark denied access from 62 to 71
access-list 106 deny ip 192.168.62.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.71.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 106 remark denied access from 61 to 72
access-list 106 deny ip 192.168.61.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.72.0 0.0.0.255
interface Fa 0/0
no ip access-group 6 in (---?)
no access-list 106


After:
no access-list 106
access-list 106 remark denied access from 61 to 71
access-list 106 deny ip 192.168.61.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.71.0 0.0.0.255
